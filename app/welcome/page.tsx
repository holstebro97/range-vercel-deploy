            I created this app for my past self. I struggled with achieving any significant results in the gym. I was
            blind to all the dysfunctions my body had. The modern lifestyle and mainstream training practices are for
            many people, including me, a sure way to create a dysfunctional body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this app is to take you from a dysfunctional body created by the comforts of modern lifestyle,
            and reverse this to create the ultimate foundation for becoming athletic. Being strong in all joints
            throughout their whole range of movement. This process can seem overwhelmingly complex, and to be honest, it
            is quite hard to make this approach not be overwhelming. So in my app I have chosen to "gamify" the journey
            to achieving range balance. The radar charts provides a visual representation of how far you are on your
            journey to range balance.

            The radar charts below visualize your progression from low tension ability to high tension ability across
            different joint functions. As you progress in your training, you'll see the area of the chart expand,
            representing your increasing strength and control throughout your joints' full range of motion.

            Most men over 30 start feeling itâ€”the stiffness, the aches, the slow loss of mobility. They wake up tight,
            struggle to squat without discomfort, and second-guess explosive movements because something might "tweak."
            It's frustrating because deep down, they know they should move better.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            They see other menâ€”some their age, some olderâ€”who are still athletic, powerful, and unrestricted. And they
            wonder:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-semibold italic">"Why can't I move like that anymore?"</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Here's the truth: It's not ageâ€”it's neglect.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem: Your Body Is Holding You Back</h3>
          <ul className="list-none pl-0 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              ðŸš¨ You wake up feeling stiff and sluggish. Instead of jumping out of bed ready to go, it takes time to
              "loosen up."
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸš¨ Your workouts feel restricted. Knees ache, shoulders pinch, and basic movements don't feel smooth
              anymore.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸš¨ Sports and activities don't feel the same. You hesitate to sprint, cut, or jumpâ€”because you don't fully
              trust your body.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸš¨ You're always "working around" tightness and pain. Whether it's sitting too long or training too hard,
              your body fights back instead of supporting you.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸš¨ You fear injury more than you should. The thought of tweaking your back or blowing out a knee lingers
              in your mind, stopping you from pushing your limits.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸš¨ You see a slow decline happeningâ€”and it scares you. You're not as athletic as you used to be, and if
              you don't fix it now, it's only going to get worse.
            </li>
          </ul>

              âœ… Waking up feeling light, loose, and powerful. No stiffness, no hesitationâ€”just a body that moves
              effortlessly.
            </li>
            <li>
              âœ… Training with confidence. Squats feel smooth, presses feel strong, and you don't need a 30-minute
              warm-up just to feel "normal."
            </li>
            <li>
              âœ… Dominating sports and daily life. Sprinting, jumping, and cutting without hesitationâ€”because your body
              is built for it.
            </li>
            <li>
              âœ… Aging like an athlete. While other men slow down, you're only getting betterâ€”staying strong, mobile,
              and pain-free for decades to come.
            </li>
          </ul>
